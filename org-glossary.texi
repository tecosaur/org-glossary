@node Summary
@section Summary

Org Glossary defines a flexible model for working with @emph{glossary-like} constructs
(glossaries, acronyms, indices, etc.) within Org documents, with support for
in-buffer highlighting of defined terms and high-quality exports across all @samp{ox-*}
backends.

@node Quickstart
@section Quickstart

To define a glossary entry, simply place a top-level heading in the document
titled @samp{Glossary} or @samp{Acronyms} and therein define terms using an Org definition
list, like so:

@example
* Glossary
- Emacs :: A lisp-based generic user-centric text manipulation environment that
  masquerades as a text editor.
- Org mode :: A rich and versatile editing mode for the lovely Org format.
@end example

Then simply use the terms as you usually would when writing. On export Org
Glossary will automatically:
@itemize
@item
Pick up on the uses of defined terms
@item
Generate a Glossary/Acronym section at the end of the document
@item
Link uses of terms with their definitions, in a backend-appropriate manner
(e.g. hyperlinks in html)
@item
Give the expanded version of each acronym in parenthesis when they are first
used (e.g. ``PICNIC (Problem In Chair, Not In Computer)'')
@end itemize

To generate an Index for certain terms, you can almost do the same thing, just
use an @samp{Index} heading and use a plain list of terms, e.g.

@example
* Index
- org-mode
@end example

To see how this all works, try exporting the following example with Org Glossary
installed:

@example
Try using Org Glossary for all your glosses, acronyms, and more within your
favourite ML with a unicorn mascot. It attempts to provide powerful
functionality, in keeping with the simplicity of the Org ML we all know and
love.

* Glossary
- glosses :: Brief notations, giving the meaning of a word or wording in a text.
* Acronyms
- ML :: Markup Language
* Index
- unicorn
@end example

If you'd like to see a visual indication of term uses while in org-mode, call
@samp{M-x org-glossary-mode}.

Term references will be highlighted according to
@code{org-glossary-fontify-type-faces}@comma{} and each highlight has the
@code{org-glossary-ref-keymap} applied@comma{} which defines left-mouse and return actions by
default.

@node Design
@section Design

In large or technical documents, there's often a need for an appendix clarifying
terms and listing occurrences; this may take the form of a glossary, index, or
something else. Org Glossary abstracts all of these glossary-like forms into
@emph{tracked generated text replacements}. Most common structures fit into this
abstraction like so:

@enumerate
@item
Search for definitions of @samp{$term}
@item
Replace all uses of @samp{$term} with @samp{f($term)}
@item
Generate a definition section for all used terms, linking to the uses
@end enumerate

Out of the box, four glossary-like structures are configured:
@table @asis
@item Glossary
The term is transformed to the same text, but linking to the
definition.
@item Acronyms
The first use of the term adds the definition in parentheses, and
subsequent uses simply link to the definition (behaving the same as glossary
terms).
@item Index
The term is unchanged (the entire purpose of the index is achieved via
step 3. alone).
@item Text Substitutions
The term is replaced with its definition.
@end table

For more details on how this works, see @ref{Structure of an export template set}.

There is a little special-cased behaviour for indexes (usage detection) and text
substitution (fontification), but it is kept to a minimum and ideally will be
removed via generalisation in future.

@node Placement of definitions
@subsection Placement of definitions

Definitions must be placed under one of the specially named headings listed in
@code{org-glossary-headings}, by default:

@example
* Glossary
* Acronyms
* Index
* Text Substitutions
@end example

If @code{org-glossary-toplevel-only} is non-nil, then these headlines must also be
level one headings. If it is nil, then they are recognised wherever they occur
in the document. Note that when using subtree export and non-nil
@code{org-glossary-toplevel-only}, only level-1 headings in the widened document will
be recognised (i.e. it behaves the same as non-subtree export).

@node External definition sources
@subsection External definition sources

Org Glossary supports searching for term definitions in other @samp{#+include}d files,
respecting the various restrictions such as headings and line number ranges. You
may also specify include paths providing definitions that should be globally
available via @code{org-glossary-global-terms}.

If you maintain a set of common term sources you may want to use, instead of
@samp{#+include}ing them, you can make use of the convenience keyword
@samp{#+glossary_sources}.

The value of @samp{#+glossary_sources} is split on spaces and to form a list of
locations. Each location is appended to @code{org-glossary-collection-root} to form the
fully qualified location. These locations are then @samp{#+include}d.

For example, if @code{org-glossary-collection-root} is set to a folder where a number
of individual definition files are places, one could then conveniently use a few with:

@example
#+glossary_sources: abbrevs physics.org::*Quantum foo bar.org
@end example

This would be equivalent to:

@example
#+include: COLLECTION-ROOT/abbrevs.org
#+include: COLLECTION-ROOT/physics.org::*Quantum :only-contents t
#+include: COLLECTION-ROOT/foo.org
#+include: COLLECTION-ROOT/bar.org
@end example

You could also set to an individual file with the beginning of a heading
specification, say @code{file.org::*}. This would allow you to have all the terms
defined in one file and include groups by heading.

Not that sources with heading/custom-id searches will automatically have
@samp{:only-contents t} added (as seen in the example). This allows for named headings
with glossary subheadings to work when @code{org-glossary-toplevel-only} is set.

@node Basic definitions
@subsection Basic definitions

Org already has a very natural structure for term-definition associations,
description lists. Term definitions are extracted from all non-nested
description lists within the glossary heading, other elements are simply
ignored.

For example, to define ``late pleistocene wolf'' you could use a description list
entry like so:

@example
- late pleistocene wolf :: an extinct lineage of the grey wolf, thought to be
  the ancestor of the dog
@end example

which is an instance of the basic structure,

@example
- TERM :: DEFINITION
@end example

@node Advanced definitions
@subsection Advanced definitions

When giving a simple definition like @samp{automaton :: A thing or being regarded as
having the power of spontaneous motion or action}, Org Glossary will actually
make a few assumptions.
@itemize
@item
Your wish to refer to the term @samp{automaton} with @samp{automaton}
@item
There is also a plural form, guessed by calling @code{org-glossary-plural-function},
in this case resulting in @samp{automata}, and you wish to refer to the plural form
with @samp{automata}.
@end itemize

This is equivalent to the following ``full form'',

@example
- automaton,automata = automaton,automata :: A thing or being regarded as having
  the power of spontaneous motion or action
@end example

which is an instance of the full structure,

@example
- SINGULAR KEY, PLURAL KEY = SINGULAR FORM, PLURAL FORM :: DEFINITION
@end example


This may seem overly complicated, but unfortunately irregular plurals and
homographs exist. Here are some examples of where this functionality comes into
play:

@example
- eveningtime=evening :: The latter part of the day, and early night.
- eveninglevel=evening :: To make more even, to become balanced or level.
@end example

Here we wish to clarify different uses of the same term ``evening'', and so define
unique keys for each usage. In writing you would use the keys like so,

@example
In the eveningtime I take to eveninglevel out the sand pit.
@end example

Let us now consider both irregular plurals and defective nouns.

@example
- ox, oxen :: A male bovine animal.
- sheep, :: A domesticated ruminant mammal with a thick wooly coat.
- glasses, :: An optical instrument worn to correct vision.
@end example

In the case of ``ox, oxen'' we give the irregular plural form explicitly. ``Sheep''
is also an irregular plural and by just putting a comma but omitting the plural
form no plural form will be generated (it will be treated as a @emph{singularia
tantum}). The same behaviour occurs with ``glasses'', and while it is a @emph{plurale
tantum} internally it will be represented as a @emph{singularia tantum}, but the
behaviour is identical and so this is fine.

@node Alias terms
@subsection Alias terms

Sometimes a term may be known by multiple names. Such a situation is supported
by the use of ``alias terms'', who's definition is simply the key of the canonical
term.

This is best illustrated through an example, for which we will visit the field
of molecular biology.

@example
- beta sheet :: Common structural motif in proteins in which different sections
  of the polypeptide chain run alongside each other, joined together by hydrogen
  bonding between atoms of the polypeptide backbone.
@end example

The beta sheet may also be referred to using the greek letter β instead of
``beta'', or as the ``beta pleated sheet''. We can support these variants like so:

@example
- \beta sheet :: beta sheet
- beta pleated sheed :: beta sheet
- \beta-pleated sheet :: beta sheet
@end example

Since the definition of each of these terms is an exact match for ``beta sheet'',
they will be recognised as an alias for that term.

@node Categorisation
@subsection Categorisation

To make working with a large collection of terms easier, you might use
sub-headings, e.g.

@example
* Glossary
** Animals
- late pleistocene wolf :: an extinct lineage of the grey wolf, thought to be
  the ancestor of the dog
- ox, oxen :: A male bovine animal.
- sheep, :: A domesticated ruminant mammal with a thick wooly coat.
** Technology
- Emacs :: A lisp-based generic user-centric text manipulation environment that
  masquerades as a text editor.
- glasses, :: An optical instrument worn to correct vision.
@end example

This structure will be ignored on export, allowing you to structure things
freely without worrying about how it will affect the export. Should you wish to
split up the exported entries into categories, this can be accomplished by using
subheadings with the @samp{:category:} tag. You can nest category-tagged subheadings
inside each other, but only the innermost category will be applied.

@example
* Glossary
** Animals :category:
** Technology :category:
*** Text Editors :category:
*** Mechanical :category:
@end example

@node Using terms
@section Using terms

Org Glossary presumes that you'll want to associate a defined term with every
usage of it. As such, on export it scans the document for all instances of a
defined term and transforms them into one of the four glossary link types:
@itemize
@item
@samp{gls}, singular lowercase
@item
@samp{glspl}, plural lowercase
@item
@samp{Gls}, singular sentence case
@item
@samp{Glspl}, plural sentence case
@end itemize

To switch from implicit associations to explicit, set @code{org-glossary-automatic} to
@code{nil} and then only @samp{gls}/@samp{glspl}/@samp{Gls}/@samp{Glspl} links will be picked up. To convert
implicit associations to explicit links, you can run @samp{M-x
org-glossary-apply-terms} (if nothing happens, try running @samp{M-x
org-glossary-update-terms} first).

Note that as Org Glossary relies on links, recognised usages can only occur in
places where a link is appropriate (i.e. not inside a source block, verbatim
text, or another link, etc.). The variable @code{org-glossary-autodetect-in-headings}
determines whether terms in headings are automatically linked. By default, this
is off and headings are ignored, since this behaviour is generally seen as
undesirable.

In addition to all this, there's a bit of special behaviour for indexing. As
you can discuss a topic without explicitly stating it, we support
@samp{ox-texinfo}-style @samp{#+[cfkptv]?index} keywords. For example:

@example
#+index: penguin
The Linux operating system has a flightless, fat waterfowl
(affectionately named Tux) as its mascot.

* Index
- penguin
@end example

@node Printing definition sections
@section Printing definition sections

When exporting a document, all identified glossary headings are unconditionally
stripped from the document. If nothing else is done, based on term usage
definition sections will be generated and appended to the document.

Fine grained control over the generation of definition sections is possible via
the @samp{#+print_glossary:} keyword, which disables the default ``generate and append to
document'' behaviour.

Simply inserting a @samp{#+print_glossary:} keyword will result in the default
generated definition sections being inserted at the location of the
@samp{#+print_glossary:} keyword. However, customisation of the behaviour is possible
via a number of babel-style @samp{:key value} options, namely:
@itemize
@item
@samp{:type} (@code{glossary acronym index} by default), the specific glossary-like
structures that definition sections should be generated for
@item
@samp{:level} (@code{0} by default), both:
@itemize
@item
The scope in which term uses should be searched for, with 0 representing the
whole document, 1 within the parent level-1 heading, 2 the parent level-2
heading, etc.
@item
One less than the minimum inserted heading level.
@end itemize
@item
@samp{:consume} (@code{nil} by default), if @samp{t} or @samp{yes} then marks terms defined here as having
been defined, preventing them from being listed in any other @samp{#+print_glossary:}
unless @samp{:all} is set to @samp{t} or @samp{yes}.
@item
@samp{:all} (@code{nil} by default), behaves as just described in @samp{:consumed}.
@item
@samp{:only-contents} (@code{nil} by default), if @samp{t} or @samp{yes} then the @code{:heading} (from the
export template) is excluded from the generated content.
@end itemize

Putting this all together, the default @samp{#+print_glossary:} command written out in
full is:

@example
#+print_glossary: :type glossary acronym index :level 0 :consume no :all no :only-contents no
@end example

@node The minor mode
@section The minor mode

A visual indication of defined terms instances is provided by the minor mode
@code{org-glossary-mode}. This essentially performs two actions:
@enumerate
@item
Run @code{org-glossary-update-terms} to update an buffer-local list of defined terms
@item
Add some fontification rules to make term uses stand out.
@end enumerate

The local list of defined terms and fontification allow for a few niceties, such
as:
@itemize
@item
Showing the term definition in the minibuffer when hovering over a fontified use
@item
Calling @samp{M-x org-glossary-goto-term-definition} or clicking on a fontified use
to go to the definition
@item
@samp{M-x org-glossary-insert-term-reference} to view the list of currently defined
terms, and perhaps insert a use.
@item
In the case of @emph{Text Substitutions}, displaying the replacement text on top of
the use, when @code{org-glossary-display-substitute-value} is non-nil.
@end itemize

@node Setting export parameters
@section Setting export parameters

The content generated for export is governed by templates defined in
@code{org-glossary-export-specs}. We will discuss them in detail shortly, but for now
we consider that in different situations we will want different generated
content. There are two levels on which this applies:
@enumerate
@item
By export backend
@item
By the type of glossary-like structure (Glossary, Acronyms, Index, etc.)
@end enumerate

This is accounted for by creating an @emph{alist of alists of templates}. This is a
bit of a mouthful, so let's unpack what exactly is going on.

First, we create associations between export backends and specs, with the
special ``backend'' @samp{t} as the default value, i.e.

@example
((t . DEFAULT-TEMPLATE-SET)
 (html . HTML-TEMPLATE-SET)
 (latex . LATEX-TEMPLATE-SET)
 ...)
@end example

When selecting the appropriate template set, we actually check each entry
against the current export backend using @code{org-export-derived-backend-p} (in
order). This has two implications:
@itemize
@item
You can export to derived backends (e.g. beamer) and things should just work
@item
If specifying a template set for a derived backend (e.g. @samp{beamer}) be sure to
put it @emph{before} any parent backends (i.e. @samp{latex}, in @samp{beamer}'s case) in
@code{org-glossary-export-specs} to ensure it is actually used.
@end itemize

The backend-appropriate template set is itself an alist of templates, like so:

@example
((t . TEMPLATE)
 (glossary . TEMPLATE)
 (acronym . TEMPLATE)
 (index . TEMPLATE))
@end example

Once again, @samp{t} gives the default value. For each of the types listed in
@code{org-glossary-headings}, the template is filled out, pulling first from the
backend-specific defaults template, then the global defaults. This gives a
complete template set which governs the export behaviour for each type of
glossary-like structure for the current backend.

@node Structure of an export template set
@section Structure of an export template set

The export of term uses and definitions is governed by @emph{template sets}. The
default template set is given by @code{(alist-get t (alist-get t
~org-glossary-export-specs))}, the default value of which is given by the
following property list:

@example
(:use "%t"
 :first-use "%u"
 :definition "%t"
 :backref "%r"
 :heading ""
 :category-heading "* %c\n"
 :letter-heading "*%L*\n"
 :definition-structure-preamble ""
 :definition-structure "*%d*\\emsp@{@}%v\\ensp@{@}%b\n")
@end example


Each property refers to a particular situation, and the value is either:
@itemize
@item
A format string that represents the content that should be used
@item
A function with the same signature as @code{org-glossary--export-template}, that
generated the replacement content string.
@end itemize

The @code{:use}, @code{:first-use}, @code{:definition}, and @code{:backref} properties are applied during
backend-specific content transcoding (i.e. using the syntax of the backend's
output), while @code{:definition-structure}, @code{:category-heading}, and @code{:letter-seperator}
are applied to a copy of the Org document just prior to the backend-specific
export process (and so should be written using Org syntax).

The format strings can make use of the following tokens:
@itemize
@item
@samp{%t}, the term being defined/used. This is pluralised and capitalised
automatically based on the link type (@samp{gls}/@samp{glspl}/@samp{Gls}/@samp{Glspl}).
@item
@samp{%v}, the term definition value.
@item
@samp{%k}, the term key.
@item
@samp{%K}, the term key buffer-local nonce (number used only once). This will only be
consistent within a particular Emacs session.
@item
@samp{%l}, the first letter of the term, in lower case.
@item
@samp{%L}, the first letter of the term, in upper case.
@item
@samp{%r}, the term reference index (only applicable to @code{:use} and @code{:first-use}).
@item
@samp{%n}, the number of times the term is used/referenced.
@item
@samp{%c}, the term category.
@item
@samp{%u}, the result of @code{:use} (primarily intended for convenience with @code{:first-use})
@item
@samp{%d}, the result of @code{:definition} (only applicable to @code{:definition-structure})
@item
@samp{%b}, all the @code{:backref} results joined with @samp{", "} (only applicable to @code{:definition-structure}).
@end itemize

The @code{:definition-structure-preamble} and @code{:heading} parameters are literal strings
also inserted to the copy of the Org document just prior to backend-specific
export stages.

To illustrate how these properties come into play, the following example uses
the property names in place of their generated content.

@example
Here's some text and now the term :first-use, if I use the term again
it is now :use. Once more, :use.

Now we have the appendix with glossary-like definitions.

:heading

:category-heading
:letter-heading
:definition-structure-preamble
:definition-structure(:definition def-value :backref)
@end example

To avoid superfluous letter headings (i.e. not helpful), we have
@code{org-glossary-print-letter-minimums}. This variable specifies a threshold minimum
number of distinct initial term letters and terms with the same letter before
the @code{:letter-heading} template should be inserted.

If @code{:heading}, @code{:category-heading}, or @code{:letter-heading} start with @samp{"* "} then
asterisks will be automatically prefixed to set the headings to an appropriate
level.

@node Creating a new glossary type
@section Creating a new glossary type

Let's consider a few examples. To start with, say we want to be able to define
indexed terms under the heading @samp{Indices} instead of @samp{Index}. To accomplish this,
all you need to do is add an entry to @code{org-glossary-headings}, which can be done
via the customisation interface or with the following snippet:

@example
(customize-set-value
 'org-glossary-headings
 (cl-remove-duplicates (append org-glossary-headings
                               '(("Indices" . index)))))
@end example

Should we actually want to have this be reflected in the export, we could
either:
@itemize
@item
Rename the @samp{index} heading to @samp{* Indices}, or
@item
Create a near-copy of @samp{index}, just changing the heading
@end itemize

In the first case, all we need to do is execute the following snippet.

@example
(org-glossary-set-export-spec t 'index :heading "* Indices)
@end example

Should we actually want to have this be reflected in the export, instead of
associating @samp{Indices} with the pre-defined index term we would first add an
@code{("Indices" . indicies)} pair to @code{org-glossary-headings} (as before).
Then, we can copy each @samp{index} template currently in @code{org-glossary-export-specs} and
simply update the default @code{:heading} as we've just done for @samp{index}.

@example
(dolist (template-set org-glossary-export-specs)
  (when-let ((index-template (alist-get 'index (cdr template-set))))
    (push (cons 'indices index-template) (cdr template-set))))

(org-glossary-set-export-spec t 'indices :heading "* Indices)
@end example

For our final example, let's say we wanted to add support for @samp{Abbreviations}.
This works in much the same way as Acronyms, just with shortened forms of words
or phrases not constructed from the first letters. After adding an
@code{("Abbreviations" . abbreviation)} pair to @code{org-glossary-headings} in the same
manner as earlier, this is as simple as:

@example
(push '(abbreviation :heading "* Abbreviations"
                     :first-use "%v (%u)")
      (plist-get t org-glossary-export-specs))
@end example

@node Tweaking specific exports
@section Tweaking specific exports

Instead of overwriting @code{org-glossary-export-specs}, it is recommended that you
instead make use of @code{setcdr} or @code{plist-put} like so:

@example
(org-glossary-set-export-spec 'latex t
  :backref "gls-%k-use-%r"
  :backref-seperator ","
  :definition-structure "*%d*\\emsp@{@}%v\\ensp@{@}@@@@latex:\\ifnum%n>0 \\labelcpageref@{@@@@%b@@@@latex:@}\\fi@@@@\n")
@end example

In this example we could alternatively set @samp{:definition-structure} to a function
to avoid the @samp{\ifnum%n>0} @LaTeX{} switch.

@example
(org-glossary-set-export-spec 'latex t
  :definition-structure
  (lambda (backend info term-entry form &optional ref-index plural-p capitalized-p extra-parameters)
    (org-glossary--export-template
     (if (plist-get term-entry :uses)
         "*%d*\\emsp@{@}%v\\ensp@{@}@@@@latex:\\labelcpageref@{@@@@%b@@@@latex:@}@@@@\n"
       "*%d*\\emsp@{@}%v\n")
     backend info term-entry ref-index
     plural-p capitalized-p extra-parameters)))
@end example

This allows for any change in other backends or the defaults you're not
particularly attached to from freely updating.

@node Adding a new export backend
@section Adding a new export backend

Adding a new export spec is as easy as pushing a spec list to
@code{org-glossary-export-specs}, for example should we want to add an @samp{ox-md} backend we
could do this:

@example
(push '(md (t :use "[%t](#gls-%K)"
              :definition "%t @{#gls-%K@}"
              :definition-structure "%d\n\\colon@{@} %v [%n uses]\n"))
      org-glossary-export-specs)
@end example

We need to remember to use @samp{\colon@{@}} instead of @samp{:} to avoid it being interpreted
as Org fixed-width syntax.

Alternatively, we could use @code{org-glossary-set-export-spec}, which has the
advantage of being idempotent, and I would argue a little clearer.

@example
(org-glossary-set-export-spec 'md t
  :use "[%t](#gls-%K)"
  :definition "%t @{#gls-%K@}"
  :definition-structure "%d\n\\colon@{@} %v [%n uses]\n")
@end example

@bye
